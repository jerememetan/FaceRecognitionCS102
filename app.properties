# --- CORE APPLICATION PATHS ---
# Base directory for storing all enrolled student data (e.g., their photos)
database.storage_path=./project
# Path to the face detector XML file (Haar Cascade)
cascade.path=./opencv-cascade-classifier/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml

# --- LOGGING ---
# Name of the file where all system events and errors are logged

# --- CAMERA AND VIDEO SETTINGS ---
# Index of the camera to use (0 is usually the built-in webcam)

# --- FACE DETECTION OPTIMIZATION ---
# Detection parameter: Image reduction factor (1.05 is standard, lower = more accurate but slower)
detection.scale_factor=1.05
# Detection parameter: Minimum number of neighbors required (5 is standard, higher = fewer false positives)
detection.min_neighbors=5
# Detection parameter: Minimum size of the face to detect (in pixels)

# --- RECOGNITION & TRAINING ---
# The confidence score required to confirm a successful face match (e.g., 0.75 = 75% confidence)
recognition.threshold=0.70
# The standardized width and height of the saved/training image (e.g., 200x200)
recognition.crop_size_px=200
# The file extension to use when saving cropped faces

# Kernel size for the blur filter (e.g., 5 means 5x5 matrix). Must be odd (3, 5, 7, etc.).

# --- CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) ---
# The contrast limit (higher means higher contrast enhancement). Standard is 2.0 to 4.0.

# The size of the grid tiles (e.g., 8 means 8x8 tiles). Smaller means more localized enhancement.
