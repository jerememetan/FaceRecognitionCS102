--- STUDENTS NEEDING ATTENTION ---
  S13234_Jin_Rae: tightness=0.8600, outliers=1, weak=1

--- RECOMMENDATIONS ---
✗ 1 student(s) have outlier embeddings
  → Remove outlier files listed above to improve recognition accuracy
⚠ Overall average tightness is low (<0.70)
  → Consider re-capturing face images with better quality:
    • Consistent lighting
    • Sharp focus (not blurry)
    • Face straight-on (±15° max)
    • Neutral expression
