## Action Items

### IMPORTANT: Recapture Training Data
With the stricter quality requirements, you should **recapture face data** for all students:

1. Delete existing face data folders
2. Recapture with new settings (recommended: 20 images)
3. System will automatically apply improved quality checks

### To Test:
```bash
# Run face capture for a student
# Observe: More frames will be rejected initially (this is good!)
# Expected: "Image rejected" for blurry/dark/low-contrast frames
# Expected: Final captured images will have quality scores >85%
```

### To Compile:
```bash
# Windows
gradlew.bat build

# Or use your existing compilation scripts
CompileAll.bat
```

### To Run Recognition:
```bash
RunFaceRecognition.bat
```

## What To Expect

### During Capture:
- ⚠️ More frames rejected (stricter quality)
- ⚠️ Longer time between captures (1200ms instead of 900ms)
- ✅ Better quality accepted images
- ✅ More diverse poses/expressions

### During Recognition:
- ✅ Higher confidence for correct matches
- ✅ Fewer false positives ("unknown" when should recognize)
- ✅ Better handling of glasses/glare
- ✅ More stable predictions (less flickering between people)

---

## Expected Results

**Conservative Estimate**: 80-90% accuracy
**Optimistic Estimate**: 90-95% accuracy

The improvements address:
1. ✅ Poor quality training images → Stricter thresholds
2. ✅ Glare from glasses → Glare reduction
3. ✅ Inconsistent predictions → Temporal consistency
4. ✅ Ambiguous matches → Higher margin requirements
5. ✅ Corrupted embeddings → Validation checks

---

## If Accuracy Is Still Below 90%

### Try:
1. Capture **25 images** per person (more training data)
2. Ensure **good lighting** during capture
3. Encourage **slight movement** between captures (natural head turns)
4. Check that OpenFace model (`openface.nn4.small2.v1.t7`) is loaded successfully

### Check Logs For:
- "Invalid embedding" warnings (should be rare)
- Quality scores consistently >85%
- Strong margin percentages (should be >15% for correct matches)
- Consistency counts (should reach 5/7 for stable predictions)
